# Project planning BEFORE iteration-1, (see chapters 1-3)

## Project Overview

A website for "MyGym”: a platform focused on providing gym services to JCU students while JCU staffs manage bookings and their memberships. Students can register for membership on the website and book their gym sessions conveniently without having to go to the university. The website will also feature an AI-powered trainer that will improve students' workout experience. The website will have revenue generated through gym membership subscriptions.

## Goals
MyGym aims to revolutionize the gym experience for JCU students by providing a centralized online platform for booking facilities and accessing personalized fitness services. By leveraging AI technology, the platform will offer tailored exercise recommendations that align with each user’s goals and physical condition, helping them achieve better results safely and efficiently. MyGym will generate revenue through a subscription-based membership model, ensuring sustainability while maintaining a high level of service quality.
