# Initial Prototypes
Firstly, before we started the coding process, we decided to come up with design ideas for our websites. 
Here are some of the prototypes that we did:

# Figma Prototypes
Then, we improved our designs more using Figma to get a realistic prototype we can use before we actually start coding.
Here are some of the figma prototypes:

# Database Diagram
Then, for backend, we came up with this database diagram.
