## 3. Database Connectivity & Issue Resolution

### 3.1 Initial Database Connection Issue
**Problem Identified:**
- ✅ **Local Development:** Database connections worked perfectly on developer's laptop
- ❌ **Multi-user Environment:** Other users experienced database connection failures after cloning from GitHub
- 🔍 **Affected Features:** Login and booking functionality completely inaccessible for external users

### 3.2 Root Cause Analysis
**Technical Investigation:**
- **Database Configuration:** MySQL connection parameters were environment-specific
- **Environment Variables:** Missing or incorrect database credentials in `config.env`
- **Connection Pool:** Database connection pool settings not optimized for multiple users
- **Network Access:** MySQL server access permissions limited to specific IP addresses

### 3.3 Resolution Implementation
**Steps Taken:**
1. ✅ **Updated Database Configuration:**
   - Standardized MySQL connection parameters
   - Added comprehensive error handling for connection failures
   - Implemented connection retry logic

2. ✅ **Environment Setup Documentation:**
   - Created detailed setup instructions for new users
   - Added `config.env.example` template with required variables
   - Documented MySQL user creation and permission setup

3. ✅ **Connection Pool Optimization:**
   - Configured connection pool limits for concurrent users
   - Added connection timeout handling
   - Implemented graceful database disconnection

### 3.4 Verification & Testing
**Multi-Environment Testing:**
- ✅ **Developer Environment:** Continued stable operation
- ✅ **Fresh Clone Testing:** New users can successfully set up and connect
- ✅ **Concurrent User Testing:** Multiple users can access booking/login simultaneously
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Testing:** Verified on different operating systems

**Current Status:** - All users can now successfully access booking and login functionality

## 4. Security & Authentication Testing

| Area | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Password Hashing | ✅ Secure | bcryptjs used |
| JWT Auth | ✅ Enforced | Expiry, signing, blacklist tested |
| Middleware Protection | ✅ Active | All protected APIs checked |
| CORS & Headers | ✅ OK | Helmet + CORS tested |
| Rate Limiting | ⚠️ Needed | Suggest express-rate-limit for prod |

---

## 5. TDD Implementation (Test-Driven Development)

### 5.1 TDD Approach
- ✅ **Red-Green-Refactor** applied across backend modules
- ✅ **Tests written first** before implementation (test-first)
- ✅ **Refactoring confidence** due to high test coverage

### 5.2 Jest Testing Framework
- **Organized** via `__tests__` directories
- **Controllers and service layers** fully tested
- **Mocked DB and token logic**

**Sample:**
```javascript
// AuthController.test.js
it('registers a user with valid input', async () => {
  const result = await authController.register(validUser);
  expect(result.success).toBe(true);
});
```
