            Gym booking is only for registered gym members. All gym members must be fully vaccinated to be able to use the gym. It is mandatory to check in at the Campus Activities Office (or the Student Hub on Saturdays) before and after each gym session. Gym members must have the Trace Together token / App running in the background of their mobile phone at all times.

            Each gym member is allowed to book up to 6 timeslots per week, each at one hour, and a maximum of 2 hours per day. Gym members must strictly adhere to all the Safe Management Measures and all the General Facilities Policies stated on the Gym Handbook while using the gym.
